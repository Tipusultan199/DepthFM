# DepthFM

DepthFM

This repository is dedicated to the reimplementation of the research paper "DepthFM: Fast Monocular Depth Estimation with Flow Matching". The goal of this project is to accurately reproduce the results and provide a comprehensive implementation of the model.
Project Overview

DepthFM is a fast and efficient model for monocular depth estimation, utilizing flow matching techniques to enhance accuracy and speed. The model leverages both low- and high-order feature interactions to improve depth prediction while maintaining computational efficiency.
Objectives

    Reimplement the DepthFM model from scratch.

    Validate and benchmark the model using standard datasets.

    Upload and maintain the full implementation and results.

Progress

    Initial setup and project structure.

    Implementation of core model architecture (upcoming).

    Training and evaluation scripts (upcoming).

    Results and performance comparison (upcoming).
